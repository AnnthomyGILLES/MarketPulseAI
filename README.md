## 🔍 What Does MarketPulseAI Do?

MarketPulseAI is an open-source, near real-time stock market analysis system that combines two powerful perspectives:

1. **Stock Market Prediction** using price data and deep learning algorithms
2. **Market Sentiment Analysis** from social media and financial news

Think of it as having two eyes on the market: one watching actual prices and trading patterns, and another watching what people are saying about stocks on social media and in the news. The system then integrates these signals to provide a holistic view of potential market movements.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Microservices Architecture**: Modular design with loosely coupled services
- **Near Real-Time Processing**: Data flows through the system with minimal latency
- **Dual Analysis Approach**: Combines price prediction with sentiment analysis
- **Comprehensive Data Validation**: Ensures high-quality data reaches prediction models
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Real-time visualization of market data and sentiment
- **Robust Monitoring**: Complete observability of system health and prediction accuracy

## 🏗️ System Architecture

MarketPulseAI follows a modern data engineering pattern with clear separation of concerns:

### Data Ingestion Layer

- **Market Data Pipeline**
  - Connects to stock market feeds via Kafka Connect
  - Collects real-time price data, volumes, and market indicators
  - Validates and routes data to appropriate Kafka topics

- **Sentiment Analysis Pipeline**
  - Monitors Twitter, Reddit, and financial news via APIs
  - Collects and filters relevant posts and articles
  - Validates content before processing

### Processing Layer

- **Market Data Analysis**
  - Spark Streaming jobs process real-time market data
  - Feature engineering extracts technical indicators
  - Deep learning models predict short-term price movements

- **Sentiment Analysis**
  - Text preprocessing and cleaning
  - NLP or Transformer models determine sentiment polarity and intensity
  - Aggregation of sentiment across different sources

### Feature Store

- **Online Features** (Redis)
  - Low-latency access to real-time features
  - Optimized caching with custom serialization
  - Configurable TTL for data freshness

- **Historical Features** (Cassandra)
  - Distributed storage for training data
  - Time-series optimized schema
  - Efficient querying for model training

### Signal Integration

- Combines predictions from market and sentiment models
- Weighted ensemble approach for final predictions
- Continuous evaluation and re-weighting based on performance

### API and Dashboard

- FastAPI service with WebSocket support
- Streamlit dashboards for interactive visualization
- Real-time updates of predictions and sentiment scores

### Monitoring & Observability

- Prometheus metrics collection
- Grafana dashboards for system visualization
- InfluxDB for time-series performance metrics
- Alerting system for anomaly detection

## 💻 Technology Stack

| Component | Technologies |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Data Ingestion** | Apache Kafka, Kafka Connect |
| **Processing** | Apache Spark Streaming |
| **Storage** | Redis, Apache Cassandra |
| **ML & Analytics** | PyTorch, TensorFlow, spaCy, NLTK |
| **API & Serving** | FastAPI, WebSockets |
| **Visualization** | Streamlit, Plotly |
| **Deployment** | Docker, Kubernetes |
| **Monitoring** | Prometheus, Grafana, InfluxDB |

## 🛠️ Why Build It This Way?

I built MarketPulseAI as a challenging end-to-end project to push my technical boundaries. Here's the reasoning behind the design decisions:

- **Microservices over Monolith**: Allows independent scaling and development of each component
- **Near Real-Time over True Streaming**: Provides excellent balance between performance and complexity without the overhead of systems like Apache Flink
- **Deep Component Configuration**: Each technology is carefully tuned - from Kafka partitioning strategies to Spark executor memory allocation and Redis caching policies
- **Open Source First**: Committed to using open-source technologies throughout to keep the project accessible
- **Local to Cloud Path**: Designed to run locally with Docker Compose first, with a clear migration path to cloud services
- **Production-Grade Monitoring**: Incorporated comprehensive observability from day one, not as an afterthought

This project serves as both a learning platform and a demonstration that sophisticated ML pipelines are achievable without massive infrastructure investments.


## 🔮 Roadmap

- [ ] Add more data sources (options flow, institutional trading patterns)
- [ ] Implement transformer-based models for better time-series forecasting
- [ ] Add support for cryptocurrency markets
- [ ] Improve Transformer models for more nuanced sentiment analysis
- [ ] Optimize performance across the entire pipeline
- [ ] Add cloud deployment templates (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- [ ] Add user authentication and multi-user support
