# MarketPulseAI: Real-Time Stock Market Analysis System

## What Does Our System Do?

Our system combines two main capabilities:  
m

1. Stock market prediction using price data and deep learning  
2. Market sentiment analysis using social media and news

Think of it as having two eyes on the market: one watching the actual prices and trading patterns, and another watching what people are saying about stocks on social media and in the news. Then, update in real time stock prediction based on social media “mood”.

## System Architecture Overview

### 1\. Market Data Analysis Pipeline

#### What It Does

- Collects real-time stock market data (prices, volumes, etc.)  
- Processes this data instantly  
- Uses deep learning to predict short-term price movements

#### How It Works

1. **Data Collection**  
     
   - Connects to stock market feeds  
   - Collects prices, trading volumes, and other market data  
   - Updates in real-time (milliseconds)

   

2. **Data Processing**  
     
   - Cleans and organizes incoming data  
   - Calculates important market indicators  
   - Prepares data for the prediction model

   

3. **Price Prediction**  
     
   - Uses deep learning to analyze patterns  
   - Makes short-term price predictions  
   - Updates predictions as new data arrives

### 2\. Sentiment Analysis Pipeline

#### What It Does

- Monitors social media and news about stocks  
- Analyzes the mood of traders and investors  
- Measures market sentiment in real-time

#### How It Works

1. **Data Collection**  
     
   - Monitors Twitter, Reddit, and financial news  
   - Collects posts and articles about stocks  
   - Filters relevant information

   

2. **Text Analysis**  
     
   - Reads and understands text content  
   - Determines if opinions are positive or negative  
   - Measures how strong these opinions are

   

3. **Sentiment Scoring**  
     
   - Combines opinions from different sources  
   - Creates overall sentiment scores  
   - Updates scores as new information arrives

## Key Technologies Used

### For Technical Readers

- Apache Kafka for real-time data streaming  
- Apache Spark for large-scale data processing  
- Deep learning frameworks for price prediction  
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) for sentiment analysis  
- Redis and Cassandra for data storage  
- Kubernetes for system deployment

## How The System Processes Data

1. **Data Ingestion (Getting Data)**  
     
   - Market data arrives from stock exchanges  
   - Social media posts and news are collected  
   - All data is timestamped and organized

   

2. **Processing (Understanding Data)**  
     
   - Market data is analyzed for patterns  
   - Text is analyzed for sentiment  
   - Both analyses happen in real-time

   

3. **Prediction (Using Data)**  
     
   - Combines market analysis and sentiment  
   - Makes predictions about price movements  
   - Updates predictions continuously

   

4. **Output (Using Results)**  
     
   - Provides real-time market insights  
   - Shows predicted price movements  
   - Displays current market sentiment
