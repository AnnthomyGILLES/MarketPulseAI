# Defining Requirements: The Foundation of MarketPulseAI
In my years of architecting data systems, I've learned that successful projects aren't built on technology choices - they're built on a foundation of clearly defined requirements. Before writing a single line of code for MarketPulseAI, I dedicated significant time to understanding the problem space through a structured requirements gathering process.

Before choosing any technologies or designing any architecture, I started with the most critical step: **defining the right questions**. Clear, thoughtful questions are the foundation of any successful system.

## Identifying the End Users

The first critical step was identifying who would actually use MarketPulseAI:

- **Technical traders**: Professionals using quantitative analysis for trading decisions
- **Data scientists**: Researchers studying market patterns and sentiment correlations

For each persona, I asked:
- What would success look like for this stakeholder?
- What information do they need?
- What actions do they need to take?
- What constraints or preferences might they have?

Understanding these different personas helped shape both the functional requirements and the delivery mechanisms. Each user type needed different interfaces and latency expectations.

### Use Case Mapping

I defined core use cases by mapping typical user journeys:

1. **Real-time market monitoring**: Tracking price movements with technical indicators
2. **Sentiment trend analysis**: Observing how market sentiment evolves
3. **Signal correlation detection**: Identifying leading indicators in either market data or sentiment
4. **Historical pattern analysis**: Studying past correlations for predictive modeling
5. **System performance monitoring**: Ensuring system health and data quality

## Business Impact and Value Proposition

Before diving into technical details, I had to answer the most important question: **How would MarketPulseAI impact the business?** This meant clarifying:

- What unique advantage would combining market data with social sentiment provide?
- How would this translate to measurable improvements in trading or analysis outcomes?
- What was the opportunity cost of not building this system?

This analysis confirmed that sentiment shifts often precede price movements by 1-3 hours for retail-heavy stocks - a clear signal of business value that justified the project investment.

## Guiding Questions for Detailed Requirements

With end users identified and business value established, I developed key questions to guide detailed requirements:

1. **Data Sources and Semantics**
   - What specific market data points would provide the most predictive power?
   - Which social platforms contained the most relevant financial discussions?
   - What business processes generate this data, and what are their inherent limitations?

2. **Freshness and Processing Requirements**
   - How fresh did the data need to be to remain actionable?
   - How quickly must we process market data to be useful?
   - What processing volume was required (millions of market data points, thousands of social posts)?
   - What latency thresholds would keep insights relevant in fast-moving markets?
   - How can we combine these two distinct data signals to generate meaningful stock movement predictions?
   - How can we deliver insights fast enough that they remain relevant in a highly dynamic market environment?
   - How can we deliver insights fast enough that they remain relevant in a highly dynamic market environment?

3. **Access Patterns and Output Requirements**
   - How would different users interact with and benefit from these insights?
   - What visualization approaches would make complex signals interpretable?
   - What APIs and interfaces would best serve different user needs?

4. **Data Quality and Validation**
   - What data quality metrics would ensure prediction integrity?
   - What business-logic checks should be implemented for market data?
   - How should we handle anomalies in both data streams?


## Functional Requirements: The System's Core Capabilities
Functional requirements describe what the system should do - the specific behaviors, features, and functionalities that the system must perform. They define the capabilities the system must provide to users and other systems.

From these explorations, I distilled the essential functional requirements:

1. **Dual-Stream Data Processing**
   - Ingest real-time market data (prices, volumes, order books) from stock exchanges
   - Collect and filter relevant financial discussions from social platforms and news sources

2. **Data Validation**
   - Implement rigorous validation for market data
   - Filter social content for relevance, credibility, and duplicate detection
   - Detect and handle anomalies in both data streams appropriately

3. **Analytics Pipeline**
   - Calculate technical indicators across multiple timeframes
   - Produce sentiment analysis signals from social media content
   - Combine technical and sentiment signals to create market predictions
   - Quantify prediction confidence based on signal strength and historical accuracy

4. **Actionable Insight Delivery**
   - Expose APIs for integration with external systems
   - Deliver real-time updates to dashboards via WebSockets
   - Create interactive visualizations for market data and sentiment trends
   - Store historical data to support model retraining, trend analysis, and system validation over time.

## Non-Functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements describe how the system should perform its functions - the quality attributes, constraints, and characteristics that affect the system's operation. They define the system's overall qualities rather than specific behaviors.

These requirements define how the system should perform its functions:

#### Performance
- **Processing Latency**: End-to-end processing time under 5 seconds from data ingestion to prediction
- **Throughput**: Capability to process millions of market data points and thousands of social posts per minute

#### Scalability
- Handle 10x normal data volume during market volatility events
- Support addition of new data sources without architecture changes

#### Data Quality
- Validate all incoming market data against expected ranges and formats
- Score social content for relevance before processing
- Track prediction accuracy and model drift metrics

#### Operability
- Comprehensive monitoring of system health and performance
- Alerting for anomalous system behavior

#### Security
- Let's skip that for now xD

#### Reliability
- I skip that too. I know i shouldn't but it's for pure pleasure and i want to focus on something else.

## ðŸ§© Core Entities - What Are the Core Things We Manage? 
Before APIs, databases, or ML models â€” I thought: what are the main "objects" in this system?

I mapped out the fundamental data structures our system would need to track:

- **MarketData**: Time-series price and volume information with associated metadata
- **SocialContent**: Posts, tweets, news articles with market relevance
- **SentimentAnalysis**: Processed sentiment scores linked to specific securities
- **TechnicalIndicator**: Calculated market indicators for different securities
- **Prediction**: Integrated signal outputs with confidence scores
- **SecurityMetadata**: Stock/asset information for reference


## End-User Validation and Iterative Delivery

Rather than attempting to build the entire system at once, I broke MarketPulseAI into smaller deliverable components:

1. First, I built a simple market data pipeline and provided sample data to end users
2. Next, I implemented basic social sentiment analysis and requested validation
3. Then, I delivered an integrated signal prototype for limited stocks
4. Finally, I expanded to the full system with complete dashboards

Each iteration created an opportunity for user feedback and validation. This approach uncovered several requirements that weren't initially apparent, such as the need for market regime detection that would adjust signal weighting during different volatility environments.

## Handling Changing Requirements

To manage evolving requirements without scope creep, I established a clear process:

1. Document all new feature requests in a centralized system
2. Meet weekly with stakeholders to prioritize requests based on business impact
3. Communicate delivery timelines transparently
4. Incorporate high-priority changes into the planned iteration cycle

This structure prevented ad-hoc changes from derailing the project while still allowing flexibility to incorporate valuable new insights.

## Key Insights from Requirements Analysis

Several critical insights emerged during the requirements gathering phase:

1. **Different data types needed specialized storage solutions** - Leading to our multi-database approach
2. **Data validation was as important as data processing** - Prompting our comprehensive validation framework
3. **Signal integration complexity demanded adaptive approaches** - Resulting in our dynamic weighted ensemble
4. **User personas had vastly different insight needs** - Informing our dashboard customization strategy

By spending time upfront defining clear requirements with end-user involvement, we avoided the common pitfall of premature technology selection and built a foundation that could evolve with changing needs and scale with growing data volumes.

The requirements framework became our north star, guiding all subsequent architectural decisions and ensuring MarketPulseAI would deliver genuine value through the fusion of market data and social sentiment.


## Conclusion

The requirements gathering phase for MarketPulseAI established a solid foundation for system design and implementation. By methodically progressing from vision to concrete specifications, I created a blueprint that balanced ambition with technical feasibility.

In my next post, I'll detail how these requirements directly influenced the architectural decisions that shaped the MarketPulseAI system.
