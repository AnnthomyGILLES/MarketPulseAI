## Resource Requirements

### Team Composition

- 1 NLP/ML Engineer (specialized in financial text)

- 1 Data Engineer (Kafka/MongoDB expertise)

- 1 Backend Developer (Python/FastAPI)

- 1 DevOps Engineer (part-time)

- 1 Product Manager/Business Analyst (part-time)

### Infrastructure

- Development environment: Docker-based local setup

- Testing environment: Cloud-based staging with scaled-down resources

- Production: Kubernetes cluster with autoscaling
