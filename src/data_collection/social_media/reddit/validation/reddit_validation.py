# This file might become empty or be removed after refactoring.
# For now, let's clear its contents as the validation logic
# has been moved to schema.py, rules.py, and validator.py.

# You can delete this file or keep it empty.
# Make sure no other parts of the system are still importing 'validate_reddit_data' from here.
